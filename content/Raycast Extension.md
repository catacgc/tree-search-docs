The extension mirrors the exact same [[Searching|search]] functionality as the Plugin itself. 
## Installing
> [!WARN] Raycast Extension Unreleased
> For now you need to build the extension from source

## Configuring

The extension needs to be configured with the plugin socket path from [[Plugin Settings#Socket Path|the plugin settings]]

Invoking for the first time the extension in Raycast, will ask for the socket path to communicate with the plugin. Copy the socket path from Obsidian as instructed above.

## Using the extension

Take this sample file in my vault:

Invoking the following example search in Raycast (a node that contains "play" and has a children "raycast"):

Invoking âŒ˜ + K opens up the command menu. The default one will be contextually selected from the [[Indexed Information|indexed node contents]]. A few examples from the file above:


| Type                                             | Screenshot                                |
